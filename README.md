# MLDS-2022-UNAL-Projects
Projects worked for the Universidad Nacional de Colombia Certificate in Machine Learning and DataScience-2022

1) Unit 1: Data visualization was performed on well logs (Volve Dataset) to identify patterns for lithology classification.
Some basic classification Algorithms such as Random Forest classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, SVM.

2) Unit 2: Using the well logs from Volve Dataset, we try to regress them in order to compute density log.
Some basic regression Algorithms such as Elsatic Net regressor, SVM, Random forest, Gradient Boosting and ANN were attempted.

3) Unit 3: Relying on Apache Spark with Databricks, I created queries and performed data visualization to answer common Oil and Gas questions among the general public to foster knowledge about the industry in Colombia.
